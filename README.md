# ðŸ¤Ÿ Sign Language Detection Model

A beginner-friendly real-time sign language detection model built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, **Mediapipe**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures input from the camera in real-time.
- **Sign-to-Text Conversion**: Converts recognized signs into text instantly.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: A basic implementation that can be further developed and improved.

## How It Works
1. Uses **Mediapipe** for hand tracking and landmark detection.  
2. Processes hand gestures with **NumPy** for feature extraction.  
3. Classifies signs using a **Scikit-learn** model.  
4. Displays the corresponding text for each recognized sign.  

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more signs and gestures.
- Enhance the model's accuracy with more training data.
- Implement a better user interface for improved usability.

This project is a great starting point for anyone exploring **computer vision**, **machine learning**, or working with **sign language recognition**.
